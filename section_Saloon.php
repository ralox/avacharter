		Going forward through double doors, enjoy the absolutely exquisite, newly refitted saloon in cherry wood. It was custom designed and built by Italian craftsmen. The saloon is ideally suited for relaxing and entertaining with a concealed large plasma screen TV, DVD, video, stereo, surround system and bar. The adjoining dining room can seat up to twelve guests, with adjustable table.
