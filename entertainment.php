						Ava's excellent entertaining areas, unique conference features, and the
						captain's flexibility, effort, and experience will make your corporate and
						event charters enjoyable and successful.  Able to entertain 49 guests at sea
						and as many as 130 in port, the Ava is unique for corporate, conference, event,
						and personal entertaining. Using a combination of the yacht and tents adjoining
						quayside in the Monaco Old Port, Ava allows flexibility for an unlimited number
						of guests for cocktails and sit-down catering.

						The huge sun deck with covered lounge has a comfortable capacity of more than 50
						persons. In addition to being a recreation area for lounging, sunbathing, and
						water sports, the versatile aft deck is capable of accomodating 18 persons for
						silver service dining. Another option is the formal dining room adjacent to the
						saloon for 12 persons in elegance. Catering is provided by our chef "a place".
						During winter months, and in case of bad weather, tents with heaters can be
						mounted over the sun deck.
