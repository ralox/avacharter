					Ava's excellent entertaining areas, unique conference features, and the
					captain's flexibility, effort, and experience will make your corporate and

					The huge sun deck with covered lounge has a comfortable capacity of more than 50
					persons. In addition to being a recreation area for lounging, sunbathing, and
					water sports, the versatile aft deck is capable of accomodating 18 persons for
					silver service dining. Another option is the formal dining room adjacent to the
					saloon for 12 persons in elegance. Catering is provided by our chef "a place".
					During winter months, and in case of bad weather, tents with heaters can be
					mounted over the sun deck.

					Our chef offers a variety of top quality buffets.  The seven professional crew
					on board can be supplemented by additional entertainment and staff i.e.
					bartenders, waiters, hostesses, guides, musicians, disc jokeys, photographers,
